FMO3 and TMAO have emerged as key components of a complex axis integrating diet and the gut microbiome with atherosclerosis<|multi_cit|> [SEP] TMAO was subsequently shown to be both proatherogenic and associated with cardiovascular risks.9 These findings raise the possibility that other dietary nutrients possessing a trimethylamine structure may also generate TMAO from gut microbiota and promote accelerated atherosclerosis. (a) Structure of carnitine and scheme of carnitine and choline metabolism to TMAO. L-Carnitine and choline (are both dietary trimethylamines that can be metabolized by microbiota to TMA. TMA is then further oxidized to TMAO by flavin monooxygenases (FMOs).,NOT_ACCURATE
"In apoliprotein E-deficient mice fed a diet with  -carnitine, the promotion of atherosclerosis was also mediated by a microbiota-dependent mechanism (<|cit|>). [SEP] Chronic dietary L-carnitine supplementation in mice significantly altered cecal microbial composition, markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA/TMAO, and increased atherosclerosis, but not following suppression of intestinal microbiota.",NOT_ACCURATE
"Dietary L-carnitine and choline, compounds abundant in red meat, are metabolized into trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) by way of some normal gut commensals; in mice TMAO enhances atherosclerosis through disrupting cholesterol metabolism and foam-cell macrophage activity [<|cit|>]. [SEP] Chronic dietary L-carnitine supplementation in mice significantly altered cecal microbial composition, markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA/TMAO, and increased atherosclerosis, but not following suppression of intestinal microbiota. Moreover, dietary supplementation with TMAO directly promoted a similar reduction in RCT. These results are consistent with a gut microbiota dependent mechanism whereby generation of TMAO impairs RCT, potentially contributing to the observed pro-atherosclerotic phenotype of these interventions.",ACCURATE
"While higher plasma levels of  -carnitine, in association with TMAO, are positively correlated with cardiovascular events in humans, intriguingly, omnivores produce more TMAO from dietary  -carnitine than vegans or vegetarians (<|cit|>). [SEP] Omnivorous subjects are shown to produce significantly more TMAO than vegans/vegetarians following ingestion of L-carnitine through a microbiota-dependent mechanism.",ACCURATE
"TMAO could be derived from increased consumption of meat (<|cit|>) [SEP] Herein we demonstrate that intestinal microbiota metabolism of dietary L-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis. Omnivorous subjects are shown to produce significantly more TMAO than vegans/vegetarians following ingestion of L-carnitine through a microbiota-dependent mechanism. They also suggest a new nutritional pathway in CVD pathogenesis that involves dietary L-carnitine, the intestinal microbial community, and production of the pro-atherosclerotic metabolite TMAO. The present studies also suggest a novel mechanism for the observed relationship between dietary red meat ingestion and accelerated atherosclerosis. The differences observed in TMAO production following an “L-carnitine challenge” within omnivore versus vegan subjects is striking, consistent with the observed differences in microbial community composition. Recent reports have shown significant differences in microbial communities among vegetarians/vegans versus omnivores 50. Furthermore, our studies have public health relevance as carnitine is a common over-the-counter dietary supplement and additive. Our results suggest the safety of chronic L-carnitine supplementation should be examined, because high amounts of orally ingested carnitine may under some conditions prime our gut microbiota with enhanced capacity to produce TMAO, and potentially promote atherosclerosis.",ACCURATE
"The microbiome can also contribute to the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease<|multi_cit|>.

"Metabolites of dietary phospholipids and nutrients produced by gut flora and found in the systemic circulation contribute to vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis<|multi_cit|>. [SEP] 5c). Interestingly, an even higher increase in plasma L-carnitine levels were noted in mice supplemented with L-carnitine on the antibiotic arm of the study (presumably as a result of the reduced capacity of the microbiota to catabolize carnitine), which failed to show enhanced atherosclerosis. TMA is rapidly further oxidized by hepatic flavin monooxygenases to form trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO).",ACCURATE
"Prevotella-dominated healthy omnivore individuals were recently reported to have increased basal levels of serum TMAO (trimethylamine N-oxide), a product of inflammation linked to atherogenesis, compared to Bacteroides-dominated healthy individuals (<|cit|>). [SEP] Several bacterial taxa remained significantly associated with plasma TMAO levels after false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple comparisons (Supplementary Fig. 8).

"renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major role in control of electrolyte homeostasis, fluid, and blood pressure. Renin and angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) cleave the angiotensinogen, the major precursor protein of RAS into angiotensin I (Ang I) and angiotensin II (Ang II), respectively (<|other_cit|>). RAS consists of ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), Ang II, and Ang II type 1 receptor (<|other_cit|>). The spike glycoprotein (S protein) on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial structural protein. It is a highly glycosylated homotrimer and can mediate the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells (<|other_cit|>). ACE2 is expressed in many other organs such as lung, stomach, kidney, brain, heart, spleen, liver, and intestines, among which the lung and small intestine are the main vulnerable parts (<|other_cit|>) with the expression on the surface of many cell membranes like pulmonary alveolar, tracheal, and bronchial epithelial cells, and also the macrophages (<|other_cit|>). ACE2 regulates the RAS by degradation of Ang II produced by ACE, and it is an important regulator of ARDS (<|other_cit|>). ACE2 is identified as the host cell functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV and virus enters the host cells by binding the S protein to ACE2 receptor and adsorbing onto it (<|other_cit|>). When SARS-CoV-2 enters the host, it will replicate, assemble, and release a great quantity of viral particles thus numerous viruses invade the body and cause disease. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the identical cell entry receptor to SARS-CoV. That is to say, the two virus SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV both use their expressed S protein to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cells. But the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for ACE2 is 10–20 times that of SARS-CoV, which improves its transmission ability (<|other_cit|>). Significantly, ACE is markedly different from ACE2. ACE also targets on Ang I to generate Ang II involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS, which leads to vasoconstriction and bronchoconstriction, increases blood vessel permeability, and triggers inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis. Thus it accelerates the progress of ARDS and lung failure in COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV infection patients (<|other_cit|>). However, ACE2 targets on Ang II to generate Ang (1–7), which improves ARDS and ACE2 gene deletion aggravates ARDS (<|other_cit|>) and thus enzyme ACE2 provides a new therapeutic method for the syndrome (<|other_cit|>). ACE2 converts Ang I to Ang (1–9) (<|other_cit|>) and Ang (1–7) and Ang (1–9) will result in reduction of inflammation and fibrosis (<|other_cit|>). Studies confirmed that it could decrease inflammation and mitigate lung injury through inhibiting ACE, or blocking the Ang II receptor in ARDS and the risk could not be increased by administration with ACE inhibitors after being infected by SARS-CoV-2, even more ACE inhibitors can increase ACE2 (<|other_cit|>). Preoperative serum ACE activity was suggested as a useful prognostic indicator in lung cancer (<|other_cit|>). Therefore, the RAS plays an important part in the process of COVID-19 and other pulmonary diseases, and quickly it becomes a hot spot to apply RAS blockers to treat COVID-19 (<|multi_cit|>) [SEP] In summary, based on the currently available evidence, treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers should not be discontinued because of concerns with coronavirus infection.

"Because PINK1 kinase activity is required for many Parkin functions and Parkin acts downstream of PINK1 <|multi_cit|>, increased JNK signaling in Pink1−/− mice may in part be due to reduced Parkin activity.

Loss of either protein in Drosophila results in a similar phenotype, with mitochondrial damage preceding muscle degeneration, as well as disrupted spermatogenesis and death of dopaminergic neurons [11]–[15]. Interestingly, overexpression of Parkin can partially compensate for PINK1 loss, but PINK1 overexpression cannot compensate for Parkin loss, suggesting that PINK1 functions upstream of Parkin in a common pathway. Consistent with these findings, we observed that exogenous PINK1-myc accumulates similarly in immortalized Parkin−/− and Parkin+/+ MEFs (Figure S2E).

Together, these results strongly support a novel model for signaling between PINK1 and Parkin in response to mitochondrial damage. In this model, mitochondrial PINK1 is rapidly turned over on bioenergetically well-coupled mitochondria by proteolysis, but is selectively stabilized on mitochondria with low membrane potential. Selective accumulation of PINK1 on the impaired mitochondria recruits Parkin, and Parkin, in turn, induces the degradation of the damaged mitochondria.

Loss of PINK1 or Parkin function due to pathogenic mutations can disrupt this mitochondrial turnover pathway which may lead to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria in vulnerable tissues—with a resultant increase in oxidative stress, depression of metabolism, and, eventually, accelerated cell death, which has been observed in Drosophila and, to a lesser extent, in mouse models of the disease [11]–[17].",ACCURATE

We observed that claudin-low tumors do show a lower pCR rate than basal-like tumors (Figure 3a); however, the pCR rate of claudin-low tumors was roughly equivalent to that of the HER2-enriched subtype (without anti-HER2 therapies) and much higher than luminal A or luminal B tumors.

Consistent with this finding, we observed a high mRNA expression of known transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin such as SNAI1, SNAI2, TWIST1, TWIST2, ZEB1 and ZEB2, and other EMT-inducing factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1a in claudin-low tumors [31] (Figure 1b, Figure S2 in Additional file 1). Thus, our data suggest that claudin-low tumors, compared with the other intrinsic breast tumor subtypes, are the most enriched for stem cell and/or TIC features, and on the basis of our vimentin immunofluorescence staining, it appears that these mesenchymal features are present within epithelial cells, which is a feature not seen in normal breast tissues.",ACCURATE
"Basal-like and Claudin-low carcinomas are mostly triple negative breast cancers (ER-PR-Her2-) associated with high resistance to chemotherapy and poor prognosis <|cit|>. [SEP] Thus, our data suggest that claudin-low tumors, compared with the other intrinsic breast tumor subtypes, are the most enriched for stem cell and/or TIC features, and on the basis of our vimentin immunofluorescence staining, it appears that these mesenchymal features are present within epithelial cells, which is a feature not seen in normal breast tissues. Claudin-low tumors are characterized by the low to absent expression of luminal differentiation markers, high enrichment for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, immune response genes and cancer stem cell-like features. Clinically, the majority of claudin-low tumors are poor prognosis estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (triple negative) invasive ductal carcinomas with a high frequency of metaplastic and medullary differentiation. Notably, claudin-low tumors showed a lower pathological complete response (pCR) rate after anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy compared to basal-like tumors (38.9% vs. 73.3% pCR rates; P = 0.08, Fisher's exact test), but their pCR rate was higher than luminal A or B tumors; interestingly, the apparent pCR rate of the basal-like tumors increased from 59% (reported in Parker et al. [9]) to ~73% when the claudin- low subtype was included, because among 18 claudin-low tumors identified in this set, 12 (67%) of 18 of them were previously identified as basal-like and the response rate of this subgroup of patients was 41.7%.",ACCURATE
"Claudin-low tumors have been recently discovered through large-scale microarray analysis of breast cancer specimens <|multi_cit|>.

These cell lines showed low expression of the ER, HER2 and claudin 3, claudin 4 and claudin 7 (Figure S4 in Additional file 1).",ACCURATE
"The hypothesis that the cluster 1-samples are enriched for immature cells is further supported by the down-regulation of GATA3 seen in these samples compared to the cluster 2 samples (p = 3.8E-9), a protein that is also down-regulated in claudin-low samples [<|cit|>]. [SEP] [9] identified the major intrinsic molecular subtypes, including the claudin-low subtype (Figure S1 in Additional file 1). The validity of the claudin-low sample cluster was confirmed by parsing the dendogram with SigClust [22] (P < 0.001); notably, this clustering analysis placed the claudin-low tumors in close proximity to the basal-like subtype and was composed of 32 arrays, representing 32 patients (~12% of all patients).",ACCURATE
"These tumors have a prevalence of approximately 7-14% and a have a poor prognosis compared to luminal A tumors [<|cit|>] [SEP] To determine for the first time the clinical-pathological characteristics of human claudin-low breast tumors, we evaluated our breast cancer patient database (UNC337) and two independent gene expression data sets (NKI295 and MDACC133) [11-13] using the nine-cell line claudin-low predictor and the previously published PAM50 subtype predictor (Figure 3a) because these two objective centroid predictors have been demonstrated to be the most robust to classify breast tumors into discrete subtypes. Across all three databases, claudin-low tumors showed a prevalence of 7 to 14%, and were mostly ER-/PR-/HER2- (also known as triple-negative tumors, 61 to 71%). Across all three databases, claudin-low tumors showed a prevalence of 7 to 14%, and were mostly ER-/PR-/HER2- (also known as triple-negative tumors, 61 to 71%).
